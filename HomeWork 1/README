 This is my implementation for the first homework for the Parallel and
 Distributed Algorithms homework. You can find the official homework paper that
 contains all the To-Dos and requirements of the homework in this repository.
 All the files written by me are marked with the same header signature as this
 readme file.

 Enjoy the open source!
