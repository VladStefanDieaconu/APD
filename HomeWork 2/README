 This is my implementation for the second homework for the Parallel and
 Distributed Algorithms course. Most of these files are part of the homework's
 skeleton. Code written by me may be found here:
 /src/SpaceExplorer.java
 /src/CommunicationChannel.java

 Code written by me is also marked with the same header signature as this README
 file. You can find the official homework paper in this repository, in order to
 read more about the homework's ToDo-s and requirements.
